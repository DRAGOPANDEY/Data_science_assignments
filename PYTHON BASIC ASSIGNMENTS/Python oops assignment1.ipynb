    "__Ans:-__ The key goals of OOP include:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__1.Modularity:__OOP promotes breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules (objects), which makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.Reusability:__ Objects can be reused in different parts of an application or even in different projects, leading to more efficient development and reducing duplication of code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__3.Encapsulation: Objects__ encapsulate their internal state (data) and the methods that manipulate that data. This helps hide the implementation details and exposes only the necessary interfaces, enhancing security and abstraction.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__4.Abstraction:__ OOP allows developers to create abstract representations of real-world concepts, focusing on the essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary complexities.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__5.Inheritance:__ Through inheritance, new classes (subclasses or derived classes) can be created based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes), inheriting their attributes and behaviors. This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical modeling of concepts.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__6.Polymorphism:__ Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common parent class, enabling more flexible and dynamic code. It enables the use of interfaces and abstract classes to define shared behaviors without specifying their exact implementation.<br>\n",
    "\n",
