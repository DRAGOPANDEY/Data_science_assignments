It is defined with a name, optional parameters, and a block of code that specifies what the function does. <br>Functions are typically created to encapsulate reusable pieces of code that can be called or invoked multiple times from different parts of a program.<br>\n",

When you make a function call, you provide the necessary arguments (if the function accepts parameters) and trigger the execution of the code inside the function.<br> The program temporarily transfers control to the function, executes the code within the function's body, and then returns control back to the point from where the function was called.\n",
